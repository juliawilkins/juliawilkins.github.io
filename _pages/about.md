Hello! I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at New York University's [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). I work in the [Music and Audio Research Laboratory](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl) under the advisement of [Prof. Juan Bello](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-pablo-bello). My current research interests lie in **machine listening** with limited labeled data, deep learning with **audio-visual data**, and the creation of new **datasets** in the **music information retrieval** space.

Prior to joining NYU, I was a Data Scientist/Engineer at [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home) in Seattle. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Music Technology at Northwestern University in 2018, and have [Prof. Bryan Pardo](https://bryan-pardo.github.io/) and the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/) to thank for fueling my interest in music information retrieval research at an early stage.

In addition to MIR research, I am also passionate about computer science education tools and animal welfare. In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, running, biking, and spending time with my geckos!
