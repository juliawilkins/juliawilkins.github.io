Hello! I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at **New York University**. I work in the [Music and Audio Research Laboratory](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl) and am advised by [Juan Pablo Bello](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-pablo-bello). My current research interests lie in **machine listening** with limited labeled data, deep learning with **audio-visual data**, and the creation of new **datasets** in the **music information retrieval** space.

Prior to joining NYU, I was a Data Scientist/Engineer at [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home) in Seattle. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Music Technology at Northwestern University in 2018, and have [Prof. Bryan Pardo](https://bryan-pardo.github.io/) and the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/) to thank for fueling my interest in music information retrieval research at an early stage.

## Publications

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EXrU-SMAAAAJ&hl=en) for now!

## Updates

- I'll be joining the audio team at Adobe Research this summer working on on multimodal machine learning with [Justin Salamon](https://www.justinsalamon.com/) and [Oriol Nieto](https://www.urinieto.com/). 

## Outreach

### Volunteering
- From 2019-2021, I was a volunteer teacher with [Microsoft TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals). I led academic year-long remote introductory Python courses at rural Washington high schools while working at Sonos, and hope to do more of this in the future!
- I'm passionate about animal welfare and finding homes for dogs in urban environments. I am currently a volunteer at the [NYC ACC](https://www.nycacc.org/). Previously, I volunteered for 2 years at the [Seattle Animal Shelter](https://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter), and before then I was at the [Evanston Animal Shelter](http://evanstonanimalshelter.net/).

### Academic Service
- ICASSP 2022, reviewer
- TISMIR 2022, reviewer


## Life

Outside of research and working with animals, I enjoy rock climbing, running, biking, exploring NYC coffee shops, and spending time with my geckos!
