Hello! I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at **New York University**. I work in the [Music and Audio Research Laboratory](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl) and am advised by [Juan Pablo Bello](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-pablo-bello) and [Magdalena Fuentes](https://magdalenafuentes.github.io/). My current research interests lie in **multimodal representation learning with audio-visual data**, **machine listening** with limited labeled data, and creating new **datasets** in these spaces in creative ways.

Prior to joining NYU, I was a Data Scientist/Engineer at [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home) in Seattle. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Music Technology at Northwestern University in 2018, and have [Prof. Bryan Pardo](https://bryan-pardo.github.io/) and the [Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/) to thank for fueling my interest in music information retrieval research at an early stage.


## Updates
- **[September 2023]** My paper in collaboration with Bosch Research was accepted to the [DCASE 2023 Workshop](https://dcase.community/workshop2023/index)!
- **[June 2023]** My [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09089) in collaboration with Adobe research was accepted to [WASPAA](https://waspaa.com/) 2023!  Check out our exciting project [website](https://juliawilkins.github.io/sound-effects-retrieval-from-video/) here!
- **[May 2023]** I'm looking forward to returning to Adobe Research in San Francisco this summer!
- **[May 2022]** I'll be joining the audio team at Adobe Research this summer working on on multimodal machine learning with [Justin Salamon](https://www.justinsalamon.com/) and [Oriol Nieto](https://www.urinieto.com/).

## Outreach

### Volunteer Work
- From 2019-2021, I was a volunteer teacher with [Microsoft TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals). I led academic year-long remote introductory Python courses at rural Washington high schools while working at Sonos, and hope to do more of this in the future!
- I'm passionate about animal welfare and finding homes for dogs in urban environments. In New York, I've worked with the [NYC ACC](https://www.nycacc.org/). Previously, I volunteered for 2 years at the [Seattle Animal Shelter](https://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter), and before then I was at the [Evanston Animal Shelter](http://evanstonanimalshelter.net/).

## Life

Outside of research and working with animals, I enjoy rock climbing, running, [cycling](https://www.kruiscx.com/), exploring NYC coffee shops, and spending time with my geckos!
